# OCaml Language Interpreter - Assignment Solution

Welcome to the repository for an assignment that involves defining an interpreter for a programming language in OCaml. This project showcases the implementation of an interpreter from scratch, covering syntax parsing, evaluation, and error handling. The repository includes all the necessary code files and documentation to help you understand and implement the interpreter. 

This assignment was completed by an OCaml Assignment Expert at [www.programminghomeworkhelp.com](https://www.programminghomeworkhelp.com). For more assistance, check out our [OCaml Assignment Help](https://www.programminghomeworkhelp.com/ocaml-assignment-help) services.


## Contents
- `src/`: Contains the OCaml source code files for the interpreter.
- `examples/`: Example programs written in the defined language to demonstrate interpreter functionality.
- `docs/`: Documentation explaining the structure and functionality of the interpreter.
- `tests/`: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the interpreter.

## Features Implemented
1. **Syntax Parsing:** Implementation of a parser to analyze the syntax of the programming language.
2. **Evaluation:** Code to evaluate expressions and statements in the defined language.
3. **Error Handling:** Mechanisms to handle and report errors during interpretation.
4. **Example Programs:** Several example programs that can be interpreted using the implemented interpreter.
